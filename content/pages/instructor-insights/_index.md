## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course *12.001 Introduction to Geology* as it was taught by Profs. Taylor Perron and Oliver Jagoutz in Fall 2013.

This course introduces students to the basics of geology through lectures, laboratory exercises, and one weekend field trip. Topics ranging from mineral and rock identification to the origin of the continents, from geologic mapping to plate tectonics, and from erosion by rivers and glaciers to the history of life are explored.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students  

- Understand and apply basic principles of geology
- Gain hands-on experience with rocks, minerals, and field observations
- Develop an awareness of the societal relevance of Earth Science

### Possibilities for Further Study

After this course, students may be interested in an undergraduate major or minor in [Earth, Atmospheric and Planetry Sciences](http://eapsweb.mit.edu).

This course is complementary to [12.002 *Physics and Chemistry of the Terrestrial Planets*](/courses/12-002-physics-and-chemistry-of-the-terrestrial-planets-fall-2008) and [12.003 *Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics*.](/courses/12-003-atmosphere-ocean-and-climate-dynamics-fall-2008)
