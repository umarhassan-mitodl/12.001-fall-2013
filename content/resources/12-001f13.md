description: The North America Tapestry of Time and Terrain. This map is a portrait
  of the land surface of North America and the ages of its underlying rock formations.
  This digital tapestry outlines the geologic story of continental collision and break-up,
  mountain-building, river erosion and deposition, ice-cap glaciation, volcanism,
  and other events and processes that have shaped the region over the last 2.6 billion
  years. (Image and text courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey.)
